# My Machine Learning Projects and Followed Tutorials

Most of this is other work that I tried to play with. Over Covid Summer, I did make a Nural Network library like PyTorch or TensorFlow from scratch but 1000x worse. 

Shout out to the Coding Train on YouTube for the tutorial

I did learn a lot though. I was following a tutorial in Java and wrote in python and decided to even create my own math library for working with matrixes. I learned a ton but NumPy would have been so much faster.
